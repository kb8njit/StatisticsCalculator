### What is a Confidence Interval?
A Confidence Interval is how much uncertainty there is with any particular statistic. It tells you how confident you can be that the results from your sample reflect what you'd expect to find from the population. 

Confidence Intervals are often used with a **Margin of Error**.

*Note: **Confidence Levels** are expressed as percentages, whereas **Confidence Intervals** are your results, and are usually numbers.*


### The Confidence Interval Formula

    X  ±  Z (s/√n)
    
    X = the mean
    Z = the chosen Z-Value from the table
    s = the standard deviation
    n = the number of observations


### Example Equation
We want to calculate the Confidence Interval of the height of the male population.

We have sampled 40 randomly chosen men, and measured their heights.

    n = 40
    
### Step 1 - Determine the *mean* value of your data
Our sample produced a *mean* of 175cm

    X = 175

### Step 2 - Determine the **standard deviation** of your data
Our sample produced a **standard deviation** of 20cm

    s = 20
    
### Step 3 - Determine your Confidence Level
We want a Confidence Interval of 95%.  Using the below table, our Z-Value is 1.960

    Z = 1.960
    
####Z-Value Table

| Confidence Interval | Z-Value |
| --- | --- | 
| 80% | 1.282 |
| 85% | 1.440 |
| 90% | 1.645 |
| 95% | 1.960 |
| 99% | 2.576 |
| 99.5% | 2.807 |
| 99.9% | 3.291 |

### Step 4 - Calculate the Confidence Interval

    X  ±  Z (s/√n)
    
    X = 175
    Z = 1.960
    s = 20
    n = 40
    
    175 ± 1.960(20/√40)
    
    Confidence Interval = 175cm ± 6.20cm
    
The Confidence Interval is **168.8cm** to **181.2cm**

*Note: The value AFTER the ± is the **Margin of Error** (6.20cm)*
