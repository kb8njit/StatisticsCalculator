### What is a Standard Deviation?

**Standard Deviation** is a measurement of dispersement in statistics.

**Dispersement** tells you how much your data is spread out around the **mean** (Example - Are all of your test scores close to the average test score?).

The *bell curve* is a tool commonly used to help understand standard deviation.

### The Standard Deviation Formula

σ = sqrt[ Σ ( Xi – μ )2 / N ]

σ = standard deviation
μ = mean
Xi = the individual x values

*( Xi – μ )2* states that for each X value, subtract the mean and square the result.

### Steps to Complete the Formula

1. Find the **mean**
2. For each number, **subtract** the **mean** and **square** the result
3. Find the **mean** of those **squared** differences
4. Lastly, take the **square root** of that value

### Example Equation

Sam has 20 rose bushes.  The number of flowers on each rose bush is listed below.  Find the Standard Deviation.
   
    9, 2, 5, 4, 12, 7, 8, 11, 9, 3, 7, 4, 12, 5, 4, 10, 9, 6, 9, 4
    
#### Step 1 - Find the Mean

    μ = (9+2+5+4+12+7+8+11+9+3+7+4+12+5+4+10+9+6+9+4) / 20
    μ = (140) / 20
    μ = 7
    
#### Step 2 - Subtract the Mean and Square the Result

*( Xi – μ )2*

    (9 - 7)2 = (2)2 = 4
    (2 - 7)2 = (-5)2 = 25
    (5 - 7)2 = (-2)2 = 4
    (4 - 7)2 = (-3)2 = 9
    (12 - 7)2 = (5)2 = 25
    (7 - 7)2 = (0)2 = 0
    (8 - 7)2 = (1)2 = 1
    ... etc ...
    
Results
    
    4, 25, 4, 9, 25, 0, 1, 16, 4, 16, 0, 9, 25, 4, 9, 9, 4, 1, 4, 9
    
#### Step 3 - Find the Mean of the Values

    = (4+25+4+9+25+0+1+16+4+16+0+9+25+4+9+9+4+1+4+9) / 20
    = (178) / 20
    = 8.9
    
#### Step 4 - Find the Square Root of the Value

    σ = sqrt(8.9)
    σ = 2.983
    
The **Standard Deviation** of the number of flowers on each rose bush is **2.983**
