### What is a Variance?
A **Variance** helps you determine how spread out your data is.  The *Sample Variance* (s2) is used to calculate how varied a sample is.

A *sample* is a select number of items taken from a population.  A sample is used in cases where it would not be feasible to take the numbers of an entire population.

For example:
You wish to measure American people's weights.  To do this, we will take a sample of 1,000 people, rather than try to obtain the weight from every single American.

The **Variance** is mathematically defined as the **average of the squared difference from the mean**.  The steps to calculate this are listed below.

1. Calculate the mean
2. Subtract the mean and square the result
3. Find the average of those differences

### The Sample Variance Formula

### Example Equation

Find the variance of the below data sample which represents the heights(ft) of trees in California.

    3, 21, 98, 203, 17, 9
    
#### Step 1
**Add** up the data points.

    3 + 21 + 98 + 203 + 17 + 9 = 351
    
#### Step 2
**Square** the value.

    351 Ã— 351 = 123,201

#### Step 3
**Divide** the value by the number of data points.

    123,201 / 6 = 20,533.5
    
#### Step 4
Take the original data points and **square** them individually.

    = (3*3) + (21*21) + (98*98) + (203*203) + (17*17) + (9*9)
    = 9 + 441 + 9604 + 41209 + 289 + 81
    = 51,633
    
#### Step 5
**Subtract** the original square value (Step 2) from the square value in Step 4.

    = 51,633 - 20,533.5
    = 31,099.5
    
#### Step 6
**Subtract** *1* from the number of items in your data set.

    = 6 - 1 
    = 5
    
#### Step 7 - Find the Variance
**Divide** the value from Step 5 by the number in Step 6.

    Variance = 31,099.5 / 5
    Variance = 6,219.9
