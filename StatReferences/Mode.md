### What is a Mode?

The **mode** is the most common number in a group of numbers.

### The Mode Formula

There is no formula to determine **mode**.  The best practice is to place the numbers in order so that you can clearly see patterns.

### Example

Find the **mode** in the below group of numbers.
 
   2, 19, **44**, **44**, **44**, 51, 56, 78, 86, 99, 99

Mode = 44
