### What is a Median?

The median is the middle point of a set of numbers. To find the median, list the data points in ascending order and then find the middle number.

For example, 28 is the **median** in the below list of numbers.

    23, 24, 26, 26, 28, 29, 30, 31, 33

### The Median Formula

Finding the Median does not require a formula, unless you have an even set of numbers.  In this case, you should find the middle two points and average them.

### Example Equation

23, 24, 26, 26, **28**, **29**, 30, 31, 33, 34

Median = (28+29)/2
Median = 28.5
